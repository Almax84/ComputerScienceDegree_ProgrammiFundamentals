#Objective: Given a list of votes, with the highest vote defined as C, return a list of length C + 1, containing all the possible students admitted to the oral exam 
 for each threshold from 0 to C included

    #Algorithm:

        # Order the votes list in ascending order
        
        # Define C as the last (thus highest) value in the ordered list
        
        # As it is requested that the list of votes be not modified, in order to have shorter iterations as the program is executed
		 it will be used a copy of the sorted votes list, from which to remove the unnecessary elements

        # Loop through the ordered list of votes C+1 times (from 0 to C)
		
				# at every loop the threshold i will be set sequentially at 0,1,2,3,...C
				
				# loop through the sorted list of votes
            
					# if the current vote is greater or equal to che current iteration index (set previously as 0<i<C+1), the number of students admitted to the oral exam will be the length of the sublist of the list of votes, from the current local index to the end.
					
					# if it is not, then set the current j-th index as the possible minimum value from which to discard smaller votes ( potentially from 0 to j ) 
                    
				# Given that the outer iteration index  is then incremented,and the list ordered, all the votes smaller than i can be discarded from the previously determined minimum value
