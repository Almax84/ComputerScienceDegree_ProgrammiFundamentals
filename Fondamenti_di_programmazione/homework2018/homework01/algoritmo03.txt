# Objective: given a list of words, and a string of text, whereby the text is the result of the concatenation of the words contained in the list, return a tuple, containing
  the list of the words which concatenated result in the text sorted by order of apparition in the text, and the word with the highest frequency
  Remove from the list of words all the words used in the text string.
  
  
  # Algorithm:
  
	# Find all the words in the text string:
		
		# Define a new list which will contain all  the the words present both in the input list and in the text
		
		# While the length of the text string is greater than zero:
		
			# Find the first word in the text  also present in the list, starting from index 0
			
			# If none of the words in the list have index 0 in the text string, remove it from the text string, otherwise..
		
			# If the found word is not null, get its index (which will be 0)
		
			# If the word is not already in the result list of words : 


						# Add it to the return list of words
				
						# Remove the word from the text string in order to make it shorter and eventually exit from the loop
		
                		    # If the word is in the input list, remove it

		
		# Find the frequency of each word and return the one with the highest value, giving priority to the one with alphabetical precedence
		
		# Return the tuple of the previous steps
